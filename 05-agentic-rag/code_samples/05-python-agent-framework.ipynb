    "## What is Agentic RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RAG follows a fixed pipeline: retrieve documents, then generate a response. **Agentic RAG** goes further by giving the agent autonomy to decide **when** and **how** to retrieve information.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Agentic RAG, the agent can:\n",
    "- **Decide** whether retrieval is needed before answering a question\n",
    "- **Choose** which data source or tool to query\n",
    "- **Evaluate** retrieved results and perform follow-up retrievals if the first attempt is insufficient\n",
    "- **Combine** information from multiple retrieval steps into a coherent answer\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the agent more flexible and accurate compared to a static retrieve-then-generate pipeline."

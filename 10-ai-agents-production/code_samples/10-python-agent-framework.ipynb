    "\n",
    "Moving AI agents from prototypes to production requires careful attention to three pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observability** — You need visibility into what the agent is doing, how long it takes, and which tools it calls. Without tracing and logging, debugging production issues is nearly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation** — Automated quality checks ensure the agent's responses remain accurate, complete, and helpful over time. An evaluator agent can score responses against defined criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cost Management** — Token usage directly impacts cost. Strategies like prompt optimization, model selection, and caching help keep expenses under control without sacrificing quality."

    "| Strategy | Description |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Prompt optimization** | Keep system instructions concise. Remove redundant context to reduce input tokens. |\n",
    "| **Model selection** | Use smaller, cheaper models (e.g. GPT-4o-mini) for simple tasks like classification or extraction, and reserve larger models for complex reasoning. |\n",
    "| **Caching** | Cache tool results and frequent queries to avoid redundant API calls. |\n",
    "| **Token budgets** | Set `max_tokens` limits to prevent unexpectedly long responses. |\n",
    "| **Batching** | Group multiple user queries into a single API call where possible. |\n",

    "# Lesson 03 - Agentic Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we explore three foundational design patterns for building effective AI agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Agent Instructions** — Crafting precise, role-defining prompts that guide agent behavior\n",
    "2. **Structured Output with Pydantic Models** — Ensuring agents return predictable, validated data\n",
    "3. **Single Responsibility Agents** — Designing focused agents that each do one thing well\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll apply each pattern to a **travel destination recommender** scenario, progressively building a system that can suggest destinations, check availability, and handle logistics."

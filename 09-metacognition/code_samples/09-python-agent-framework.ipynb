    "\n",
    "Metacognition is **thinking about thinking**. In the context of AI agents, it means building agents that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-reflect** on their own outputs and reasoning process\n",
    "- **Detect errors** and recover gracefully instead of failing silently\n",
    "- **Evaluate** whether their responses are complete and helpful\n",
    "- **Adapt** their strategy when an initial approach doesn't work (e.g., falling back to a backup system)\n",

    "A metacognitive agent doesn't just answer questions — it monitors its own performance and adjusts on the fly."

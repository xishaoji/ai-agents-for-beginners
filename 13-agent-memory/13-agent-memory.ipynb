    "\n",
    "AI agents can leverage different kinds of memory, each serving a distinct purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working Memory\n",
    "The conversation thread itself — the messages exchanged in a single session. The agent can refer back to earlier messages in the same thread to maintain coherence. In MAF this is created via **`agent.create_session()`**, which returns an `AgentSession`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-Term Memory\n",
    "Information that persists for the duration of a task or session but is not stored permanently. For example, the agent may accumulate facts during a multi-turn planning conversation and use them to produce a final itinerary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-Term Memory\n",
    "Preferences and facts that persist **across sessions**. A returning user should not have to repeat their dietary restrictions or travel style. Long-term memory is typically backed by an external store — a database, file, or vector index — and surfaced to the agent via tools."

    "## Working Memory with Sessions\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lesson you learned three types of agent memory and how to implement them with the Microsoft Agent Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | MAF Mechanism | Lifetime |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Working** | `agent.create_session()` | Single conversation |\n",
    "| **Short-term** | Accumulated context within a thread | Single task / session |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | External store accessed via `@tool` functions | Across sessions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "1. **`agent.create_session()`** provides working memory — the agent sees the full conversation history within a session.\n",
    "2. **New sessions lose context** — without long-term memory the agent cannot recall past conversations.\n",
    "3. **`@tool` functions** bridge the gap — they let the agent save and retrieve information from a persistent store.\n",
    "4. **Personalization improves over time** — the more preferences are stored, the better the agent's recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "- **Customer Service**: Remember customer history and preferences\n",
    "- **Personal Assistants**: Maintain context across days or weeks\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Track patient information and preferences\n",
    "- **E-commerce**: Personalized shopping based on history\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Replace the in-memory dict with a database or vector store (e.g. Azure AI Search)\n",
    "- Add memory expiration for time-sensitive information\n",
    "- Build multi-agent systems with shared memory\n",
    "- Explore the Cognee notebook for knowledge-graph-backed memory"

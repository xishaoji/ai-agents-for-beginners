    "## Why Multi-Agent Systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world tasks like trip planning involve many different kinds of expertise — logistics, local knowledge, budgeting, and more. A single agent trying to handle everything quickly becomes unwieldy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent systems solve this through **specialization**: each agent focuses on one area of expertise, producing higher-quality results than a generalist. They also improve **scalability** — you can add new agents (e.g., a flight specialist, a restaurant critic) without rewriting the existing workflow. The agents compose together through a structured pipeline, passing context from one to the next."
